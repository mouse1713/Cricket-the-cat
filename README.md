    <h1>Steps on raising a kitten</h1>
    <h2>12 days old to one year old</h2>
      <p>Kittens need to be kept warm by using a heating pad. At this young age they don’t regulate their body temperature. They will need to be bottle fed every 3-4 hours with kitten formula and then burped in case they swallowed any air. Then you’ll need to teach them how to go to the bathroom. Most important is to give them lots of love like their mom would. Below are supplies you’ll need:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Bottle for kittens</li>
         <li>Kitten formula</li>
         <li>Heating pad</li>
         <li>Kitty litter</li>
         <li>Lots of toys</li>
         <li>a lot of love</li>
       </ul>
